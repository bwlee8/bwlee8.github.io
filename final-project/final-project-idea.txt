My final project idea is to build a website that hosts the photos I have taken while traveling. I want to format it in "modern" and minimalistic layout. The main page will ideally have a single photo of each city/state/country I have been to. Click on one of the photo will direct you to another webpage displaying more photos of that location. The main page will have a search function to specify results.
